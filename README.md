# final-O_O

Start with ann27_final.pdf, and the pdf will mention that the plots are available in Final Plots.docx when plots were asked to be reported.

Each Problem's code are labelled accordingly. Note: There are extra plots that come up when you run the code, but these plots were used for visuals, not because they were asked to be reported.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
